There are 15 trees in the grove, and after the workers plant more, there will be 21 trees. How many did they plant?\n\nYou're correct that the difference between 15 and 21 is the number of trees planted: 21 - 15 = 6 trees.\n\n2. If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more arrive, how many cars are there now?\n\nYou're right again! There were originally 3 cars, and then 2 more arrived, making a total of 3 + 2 = 5 cars.\n\n3. Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many do they have left?\n\nYou correctly calculated the original number of chocolates: 32 + 42 = 74. Then, you subtracted the 35 eaten to get the remaining amount: 74 - 35 = 39.\n\n4. Jason had 20 lollipops and gave some to Denny. Now he has 12 left. How many did he give?\n\nYou're correct that Jason must have given away the difference between his original 20 lollipops and his current 12: 20 - 12 = 8.\n\n5. Shawn had 5 toys and received 2 from each of his mom and dad for Christmas. How many does he have now?\n\nYou correctly calculated the total number of toys: 5 + (2 x 2) = 9.\n\n6. There were 9 computers in the server room, and 5 more were installed each day from Monday to Thursday. How many are there now?\n\nYou're right that 4 days with 5 new computers each means a total of 20 additional computers: 4 x 5 = 20. Adding these to the original 9 gives you a total of 29.\n\n7. Michael had 58 golf balls and lost some on Tuesday and Wednesday. How many does he have left?\n\nYou correctly calculated the number of golf balls remaining after losing 23 on Tuesday: 58 - 23 = 35. Then, you subtracted the additional 2 lost on Wednesday to get the final amount: 35 - 2 = 33.\n\n8. Olivia had $23 and spent $15 on bagels. How much does she have left?\n\nYou're correct"]}

To find out how many cats are left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats:\n\n* 18 (total cats) - 10 (cats sold) = 8 cats\n\nSo, the pet store has 8 cats left!"]}

{"id": 3, "answer": "", "completion": "", "completions": ["Let's help you solve this problem!\n\nThe cafeteria ordered a total of 42 + 7 = 49 apples.\n\nIf only 9 students wanted fruit, that means they didn't take all the apples. To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, we need to subtract the number of apples taken by the students from the total number of apples:\n\n49 (total apples) - 9 (apples taken by students) = 40\n\nSo, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples!"]}

I'd be happy to assist you in solving them.\n\nThe problem you provided is:\n\nCarol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?\n\nLet's break it down step by step!\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many carrots they picked in total. Carol picked 29, and her mom picked 16, so together they picked:\n\n29 + 16 = 45\n\n2. Next, we know that only 38 of the carrots were good. This means that the remaining carrots are bad.\n\n3. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:\n\n45 (total) - 38 (good) = 7\n\nSo, Carol and her mom had 7 bad carrots!"]}

I'd be happy to assist you in solving them.\n\nLet's go through each question together:\n\n1. There are 15 trees in the grove, and after planting, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant?\n\nYou're correct that the difference between the initial number of trees (15) and the final number of trees (21) is the number of trees planted. So, we subtract 15 from 21 to get:\n\n21 - 15 = 6\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 6.\n\n2. If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\nYou're right again! We add the initial number of cars (3) to the number of new cars arriving (2):\n\n3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 5.\n\n3. Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\n\nYou're correct that we need to find the initial number of chocolates by adding Leah's and her sister's chocolates:\n\n32 + 42 = 74\n\nThen, we subtract the number of chocolates eaten (35) from the total:\n\n74 - 35 = 39\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 39.\n\n4. Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\n\nYou're right again! We subtract the initial number of lollipops (20) from the new number of lollipops Jason has (12):\n\n20 - 12 = 8\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 8.\n\n5. Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?\n\nYou're correct that we need to add the initial number of toys (5) to the number of new toys received:\n\n5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n\nSo, the answer is indeed 9.\n\n6.
