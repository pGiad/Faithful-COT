Adding these to the initial 9, we get `computers_now = 9 + 20 = 29`.\n\n3. **Soda left**: Danny drinks 90% of one bottle and gives away 70% of two bottles. He has 3 bottles initially. The fraction of soda left is `(1 - 0.9) + (1 - 0.7) * 2 = 0.2 + 0.6 = 0.8`. As a percentage, this is `percent_soda_left = 0.8 * 100 = 80`.\n\n4. **Fruit salad**: Let's solve the equation: `green_grapes + red_grapes + raspberries = 102`. We can find `green_grapes` by solving for it: `green_grapes = (102 - raspberries - red_grapes) / 1`. Then, we can find `red_grapes`: `red_grapes = 3 * green_grapes + 7`. Plugging in the values, we get `red_grapes = 21`.\n\n5. **Denise's age**: Denise will be 25 years old in two years. Her sister Diane is 4 years younger. So, Diane is currently `age_diane_now = 25 - 2 - 4 = 19` years old. In how many years will she be 25? `years_until_diane_25 = 25 - 19 = 6`.\n\n6. **Recyclable cans and bottles**: There are initially 90 people, with 50 soda cans, 50 sparkling water bottles, and 50 juice bottles. One-half of the guests drink soda, one-third drink sparkling water, and four-fifths consume juices. The total number of recyclable items is `cans_and_bottles_collected = 45 + 30 + 40 = 115`.\n\n7. **Egg farm**: Mark supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs (60) and another store with 30 eggs each day. In a week, he supplies these two stores with `eggs_week = 60 * 2 + 30 * 7 = 240` eggs.\n\n8. **Rebecca's earrings**: For every earring, Rebecca uses 2 magnets, half as many buttons (1), and three times as many gemstones (3). She wants to make 4 sets of earrings. The total number of gemstones needed is `gemstones_4_sets = 3 * 4 = 12`.\n\n9. **Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, who has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has `charleston_sheep = 4 * 20 = 80` and Toulouse has `toulouse_sheep = 2 * 80 = 160`. Together, they have `total_sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260` sheep."]}

To find out how much soda he has left, calculate the fraction of each bottle that remains: `fraction_drink_left = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1`, `fraction_give_left = (1 - 0.7) * 2 = 0.4`. Add these fractions together to get the total fraction of soda left: `fraction_soda_left = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5`. Convert this to a percentage: `percent_soda_left = 0.5 * 100 = 50`\n\n**4. Fruit salad**\nLet's solve for `green_grapes` using the equation: `green_grapes + (3 * green_grapes) + 7 + (green_grapes - 5) = 102`. Simplify and solve for `green_grapes`: `6 * green_grapes = 97`, so `green_grapes = 16.17`. Now, calculate the number of red grapes: `red_grapes = 3 * 16.17 + 7 = 52.51`. Round this to the nearest integer: `answer = 53`\n\n**5. Denise's age**\nDenise will be 25 years old in two years. Her sister Diane is 4 years younger. So, Diane is currently 21 years old (25 - 2). In how many years will Diane be 25? Subtract her current age from the target age: `years_until_diane_25 = 25 - 21 = 4`\n\n**6. Recyclable cans and bottles**\nThere are initially 90 people at the picnic, with 50 soda cans, 50 plastic bottles of sparkling water, and 50 glass bottles of juice. One-half of the guests drank soda, one-third drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed. Calculate the number of recyclable items collected: `cans_and_bottles_collected = (90 * 1/2) + (90 * 1/3) + (50 * 4/5) = 45 + 30 + 40 = 115`\n\n**7. Mark's egg farm**\nMark supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs and another store with 30 eggs each day. Calculate the total number of eggs supplied per day: `eggs_one_store_each_day = 5 * 12 = 60`, `eggs_another_store_each_day = 30`. For a week, this adds up to: `eggs_week = (60 + 30) * 7 = 840`\n\n**8. Rebecca's earrings**\nRebecca makes her own earrings using buttons, magnets, and gemstones. For every earring, she uses two magnets, half as many buttons as magnets, and three times as many gemstones as buttons. If she wants to make 4 sets of earrings, calculate the total number of gemstones needed: `gemstones_per_set = (2 * 1/2) * 3 = 3`, `gemstones_4_sets = 3 * 4 = 12`\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain any of these steps in more detail!"]}

If Rebecca wants to make 4 sets of earrings, how many gemstones will she need?\n\ngemstones_4_sets = (2 * 3) * 12 * 4 = 144\n\n9. Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and$30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary?\n\nsalary_per_year = (20 * 35) * 50 + (30 * 15) * 50 = 3500 + 2250 = 5750"]}

To find out how much soda he has left, calculate the fraction of a bottle that remains after drinking and giving away some: `fraction_soda_left = (1 - 0.9) + ((1 - 0.7) * 2) = 0.2`. Convert this to a percentage: `percent_soda_left = 0.2 * 100 = 20`\n\n**4. Fruit salad**\nLet's solve the equation: `green_grapes_val = solve_it(Eq(102, green_grapes + (3 * green_grapes) + (green_grapes - 5)), green_grapes)[green_grapes]`.

Her sister Diane is 4 years younger. So, Diane will be 25 in: `years_until_diane_25 = 25 - (age_denise_now - 4) = 21` years.\n\n**6.
