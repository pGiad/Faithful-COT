So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 Ã $4 = $20.\n\nThe problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so we can set up an equation:\n\nPrice of doll = Price of 3 action figures\nx = 3x\n\nSince x is the price of one action figure, this means that the price of the doll is also 3 times the price of one action figure. This makes sense, since the problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.\n\nNow we can find the total cost of all toys:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of doll\n= $20 + (Number of action figures Ã Price of each action figure) + x\n\nWe know that there are 3 action figures, so substitute this value in:\n\nTotal cost = $20 + (3 Ã x) + x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nTotal cost = $20 + 4x\n\nNow we need to find the total worth of all toys. Since one action figure costs $5, we can substitute this value for x:\n\nTotal worth = $20 + 4($5)\n= $20 + $20\n= $40\n\nSo, the total worth of all toys is $40."]}

Synthetic Gut: Andy needs to restring 3 racquets with synthetic gut. It takes him an average of 15 minutes per racquet. So, the total time he'll spend on synthetic gut is:\n\n3 racquets Ã 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes\n\n2. Polyester String: Andy needs to restring 5 racquets with polyester string. It takes him an average of 22 minutes per racquet. So, the total time he'll spend on polyester string is:\n\n5 racquets Ã 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes\n\n3. Hybrid Sets: Andy needs to restring 4 racquets with hybrid sets (half synthetic gut and half polyester string). It takes him an average of 18 minutes per racquet. So, the total time he'll spend on hybrid sets is:\n\n4 racquets Ã 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes\n\nNow, let's add up the total time Andy will spend restringing all the racquets:\n\n45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester string) + 72 minutes (hybrid sets) = 227 minutes\n\nTo convert this to hours and minutes, we can divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n227 minutes Ã· 60 = 3.78 hours\n\nSo, it will take Andy approximately 3 hours and 47 minutes to restring all the racquets!"]}

Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the bottom shelf can hold 40 books (20 x 2).\n\nNow, let's add up the number of books that each shelf can hold:\n\nBottom shelf: x\nMiddle shelves: 20\nTop shelf: x - 5\n\nTotal number of books that all shelves can hold is:\nx + 20 + (x - 5) = 110\n\nCombine like terms:\n2x - 5 = 110\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n2x = 115\n\nDivide by 2:\nx = 57.5\n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a shelf, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, x is approximately 58.\n\nNow that we know how many books each shelf can hold, let's find out how many bookcases Elly needs:\n\nBottom shelf: 58\nMiddle shelves: 2 x 10 = 20\nTop shelf: 58 - 5 = 53\n\nTotal number of books on all shelves is:\n58 + 20 + 53 = 131\n\nSince Elly has 110 books, she only needs to fill the shelves with 110 books. She can do this by using:\n\nBottom shelf: 40\nMiddle shelves: 20\nTop shelf: 50 (since 50 is less than or equal to 58)\n\nSo, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books!"]}
