How much will each carton cost?\nEach carton costs $4.00.\n\nFinal Answer: How much will Cynthia spend on ice cream after 60 days?\n\nShe'll buy 4 cartons, and each carton costs $4.00, so:\n4 cartons x $4/carton = $16\n\nCynthia will spend a total of $16 on ice cream after 60 days."]}

What is Bailey's total amount of money at the end of the 8 weeks?\nAccording to the problem, she has a total of $100 after receiving her weekly allowance for 8 weeks.\n\nFinal Answer: How much money did Bailey start with?\n\nLet's use the information from Q2 and Q3 to find out how much Bailey received in total:\n\n$5 per week × 8 weeks = $40\n\nNow, we know that Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of the 8 weeks. To find out how much she started with, we can subtract the amount she received from her total:\n\n$100 - $40 = $60\n\nSo, Bailey started with $60."]}

What is the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3?\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, or 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nP(>3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 3/6\n= 1/2\n\nQ3. What is the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row?\nThe probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each event:\n\nP(even, even) = P(even) × P(even)\n= (Number of favorable outcomes for first roll) / Total number of possible outcomes\n× (Number of favorable outcomes for second roll) / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 3/6 × 2/6\n= 1/6\n\nQ4. How much more likely is it that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?\nTo find the difference between the two probabilities, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:\n\nDifference = P(>3) - P(even, even)\n= (1/2) - (1/6)\n= 3/6\n\nExpressed as a percentage, this difference is:\n\n(3/6) × 100% ≈ 50%\n\nSo, Jerry is approximately 50% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."]}

What is his hourly wage?\nHe earns $10 per hour.\n\nQ4. What is the weekly bonus if the company performs well?\nHe gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.\n\nFinal Answer: How much money did Watson make in April?\n\nFirst, let's calculate Watson's total hours worked in a week:\n10 hours/day × 5 days/week = 50 hours/week\n\nNext, let's calculate his weekly earnings:\n$10/hour × 50 hours/week = $500/week\n\nSince the company performed very well for the whole month of April (which has 4 weeks), Watson will receive a bonus for each week. Therefore, he will get:\n\n$300/week × 4 weeks/month = $1200/month\n\nAdding his weekly earnings to the monthly bonus, Watson's total earnings in April are:\n$500/week × 4 weeks/month + $1200 = $2200\n\nThe answer is $2200."]}

How many hours can one person paint half a house in 5 days?\nSince it takes 5 days to paint half a house, one person can paint half a house in 5 x 8 = 40 hours (assuming an 8-hour workday).\n\nQ2. What is the total area of the whole house that needs to be painted?\nThe whole house is twice the size of half a house, so it's 2 x 40 = 80 hours.\n\nQ3. How many people are there to paint the whole house?\nThere are 5 people.\n\nFinal Answer: How many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?\n\nSince one person can paint half a house in 40 hours, 5 people can paint the same amount of area (half a house) in 40/5 = 8 hours. Since there's twice as much area to cover (the whole house), it would take them 2 x 8 = 16 hours to finish painting the whole house.\n\nThe answer is 16 hours."]}

What is the new weight that he uses after increasing it by 50%?\nTo find this, we need to calculate 8 + (50% of 8). Since 50% of 8 is 4, the new weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n\nQ4. Why does Jamaal use a weight two pounds lighter than that?\nBecause it's too heavy for him.\n\nFinal Answer: What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?\n\nJamaal uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds, which means he uses a weight of 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

What is the width of each plant?\nEach plant grows 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot).\n\nQ3. How much space does Pat need between each plant?\nPat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.\n\nQ4. How many plants can fit in the flower bed?\nTo find out how many plants can fit, we'll subtract the width of one plant (1 foot) from the total length of the flower bed (111 feet), and then divide by the space needed between each plant (1.5 feet).\n\n111 - 1 = 110\n110 / 1.5 = 73\n\nSo, Pat needs to buy 73 plants.\n\nQ5. How much will it cost to buy these plants?\nEach plant costs $6 at the store, so we'll multiply the number of plants by the cost per plant:\n\n73 x $6 = $438\n\nQ6. Does Pat already own some plants?\nYes, Pat already owns 17 flowers.\n\nQ7. How many plants does Pat need to buy in total?\nTo find out how many plants Pat needs to buy, we'll subtract the number of plants she already owns from the total number of plants needed:\n\n73 - 17 = 56\n\nSo, Pat needs to buy 56 plants.\n\nFinal Answer: How much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?\nPat will spend $6 x 56 = $336 at the store."]}

How much money did Teresa earn from the sales?\nTeresa earned $120.\n\nQ2. What is the price ratio between large and small stuffed animals?\nLarge stuffed animals are three times the price of small ones, so if x is the price of a small one, then the price of a large one is 3x.\n\nQ3. How many small stuffed animals did Teresa sell compared to large ones?\nTeresa sold twice as many small ones as large ones, so let's say she sold L large ones and 2L small ones (since 2L = L).\n\nQ4. What is the total revenue from selling both types of stuffed animals?\nThe total revenue is the sum of the revenue from selling large and small ones:\n\nRevenue from large ones: 3x \\* L\nRevenue from small ones: x \\* 2L\n\nTotal Revenue: (3x \\* L) + (x \\* 2L)\n\nQ5.

How much did Russell spend on bagels in total?\nRussell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, he spent 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.\n\nQ2. What is the discount amount?\nThe discount is 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.\n\nQ3. How much will Russell pay after the discount?\nHe paid $40.00 initially, and now he gets a $4.00 discount. So, he pays $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.\n\nQ4.

To find out how many Johnny bought, we need to calculate thrice as many as Mike first.\n\nQ3: What is thrice as many as Mike's face masks?\nThrice as many as Mike's face masks means 3 times the number of face masks Mike bought. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, thrice as many would be:\n\n3 x 5 = 15\n\nSo Johnny bought thrice as many as Mike.\n\nQ4: How many more did Johnny buy than thrice as many as Mike?\nJohnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We already calculated that thrice as many is 15, so we add 2 to that:\n\n15 + 2 = 17\n\nFinal Answer: How many face masks did Johnny buy?\nJohnny bought 17 face masks.\n\nThe answer is 17."]}

How many yellow candies are there?\nSince there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.\n\nFinal Answer: How many pink candies are there?\n\nLet's use the information we've gathered so far to find the number of pink candies. Since we know the total number of candies (232) and the number of each color candy, we can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies:\n\n232 - 54 (red) = 178\n178 - 108 (orange) = 70\n70 - 27 (yellow) = 43\n\nSo, there are 43 pink candies."]}

How many legs do chickens have?\nChickens have 2 legs each.\n\nQ4. How many legs do cows have?\nCows have 4 legs each.\n\nFinal Answer: How many of the animals are chickens?\n\nLet's use the information that there are 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs. We can start by using the fact that all animals are either chickens or cows. Let's say x is the number of chickens. Then, the remaining animals (20 - x) must be cows.\n\nWe know that each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs from the chickens is 2x. Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from the cows is 4(20 - x). The total number of legs is the sum of these two expressions: 2x + 4(20 - x) = 70.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2x + 80 - 4x = 70\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2x = -10\n\nDivide by -2:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 chickens.
