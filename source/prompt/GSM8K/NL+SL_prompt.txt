I will give you some examples with questions and answers. The answers are subquestions to the initial problem in Python comments and below the comments the coresponding Python code. I want you to answer my final question in the way the questions of the examples are answered. Do NOT analyze the examples. Just give me the answer of the final question in the form of the examples and DON'T say anything else.

# Example 1
# Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
# 1. How many trees are there in the beginning? (independent, support: ["There are 15 trees"])
trees_begin = 15
# 2. How many trees are there in the end? (independent, support: ["there will be 21 trees"])
trees_end = 21
# 3. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? (depends on 1 and 2, support: [])
trees_today = trees_end - trees_begin
# 4. Final Answer: How many trees did the grove workers plant today? (depends on 3, support: [])
answer = trees_today

# Example 2
# Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
# 1. How many computers were there in the beginning? (independent, support: ["There were nine computers"])
computers_begin = 9
# 2. How many computers were installed each day? (independent, support: ["Five more computers were installed each day"])
computers_each_day = 5
# 3. How many days were there from monday to thursday? (independent, support: ["External knowledge: days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, so there are 4 days from Monday to Thursday"])
days_monday_to_thursday = 4
# 4. How many new computers were installed? (depends on 2 and 3, support: [])
computers_new = 0
for i in range(days_monday_to_thursday):
    computers_new += computers_each_day
# 5. How many computers are now in the server room? (depends on 1 and 4, support: [])
computers_now = computers_begin + computers_new
# 6. Final Answer: How many computers are now in the server room? (depends on 5, support: [])
answer = computers_now
