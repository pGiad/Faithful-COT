I will give you some examples with questions and answers. The answers are executable Python code that generates the desired output. I want you to answer my final question in the way the questions of the examples are answered. Do NOT analyze the examples. Just give me the answer of the final question in the form of the examples and DON'T say anything else.

# Example 1
# Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
trees_begin = 15
trees_end = 21
trees_today = trees_end - trees_begin
answer = trees_today

# Example 2
# Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
computers_begin = 9
computers_each_day = 5
days_monday_to_thursday = 4
computers_new = 0
for i in range(days_monday_to_thursday):
    computers_new += computers_each_day
computers_now = computers_begin + computers_new
answer = computers_now
